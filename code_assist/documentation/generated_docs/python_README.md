# python.py - Documentation

## File Overview
This file provides a collection of small, independent utility functions covering basic string manipulations, number checks, list generation, and simple shopping cart calculations.
Its main responsibility is to offer readily available operations that can be used across different parts of a larger application.
It serves as a simple toolkit for common, straightforward programming tasks.

## Key Components

### Functions

-   **`reverse_string(text)`**: Reverses the order of characters in a given string. It achieves this using Python's slice notation `[::-1]`.
    -   **Parameters**: `text` (str) - The string to be reversed.
    -   **Returns**: (str) - The reversed string.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        reversed_text = reverse_string("documentation")
        print(reversed_text) # Output: noitatnemucod
        ```

-   **`word_count(text)`**: Counts the number of words in an input string. It determines words by splitting the string at whitespace characters.
    -   **Parameters**: `text` (str) - The string whose words are to be counted.
    -   **Returns**: (int) - The total count of words.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        words = word_count("This is a test string.")
        print(words) # Output: 5
        ```

-   **`to_upper(text)`**: Converts all characters in a given string to their uppercase equivalent.
    -   **Parameters**: `text` (str) - The string to convert.
    -   **Returns**: (str) - The string in uppercase.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        upper_text = to_upper("hello python")
        print(upper_text) # Output: HELLO PYTHON
        ```

-   **`is_even(num)`**: Checks whether a given integer is an even number. It uses the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
    -   **Parameters**: `num` (int) - The number to check.
    -   **Returns**: (bool) - `True` if the number is even, `False` otherwise.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        print(is_even(4)) # Output: True
        print(is_even(7)) # Output: False
        ```

-   **`generate_numbers(start, end)`**: Generates a list of integers within a specified range, inclusive of both the starting and ending numbers.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `start` (int) - The first number in the range.
        -   `end` (int) - The last number in the range.
    -   **Returns**: (list) - A list containing integers from `start` to `end`.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        numbers_list = generate_numbers(1, 5)
        print(numbers_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        ```

-   **`calculate_total_price(cart)`**: Calculates the sum of `(price * quantity)` for all items in a shopping cart. It only includes items with a positive price.
    -   **Parameters**: `cart` (list of dicts) - A list where each dictionary represents an item and must contain "price" (numeric) and "quantity" (numeric) keys.
    -   **Returns**: (float or int) - The calculated total price.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        my_cart = [{"price": 10.0, "quantity": 2}, {"price": 5.0, "quantity": 3}]
        total = calculate_total_price(my_cart)
        print(total) # Output: 35.0
        ```

-   **`calculate_discounted_price(cart)`**: Calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart and then applies a fixed 10% discount to that total. It reuses the same logic as `calculate_total_price` for the base calculation.
    -   **Parameters**: `cart` (list of dicts) - Same structure as for `calculate_total_price`.
    -   **Returns**: (float or int) - The total price after a 10% discount.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        my_cart = [{"price": 10.0, "quantity": 2}] # Base total: 20.0
        discounted_total = calculate_discounted_price(my_cart)
        print(discounted_total) # Output: 18.0
        ```

-   **`calculate_taxed_price(cart)`**: Calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart and then applies a fixed 18% tax to that total. It reuses the same logic as `calculate_total_price` for the base calculation.
    -   **Parameters**: `cart` (list of dicts) - Same structure as for `calculate_total_price`.
    -   **Returns**: (float or int) - The total price after an 18% tax.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        my_cart = [{"price": 10.0, "quantity": 2}] # Base total: 20.0
        taxed_total = calculate_taxed_price(my_cart)
        print(taxed_total) # Output: 23.6
        ```

### Classes
This file does not contain any classes.

## Execution Flow
When `python.py` is executed directly (e.g., `python python.py`):
1.  The Python interpreter executes the code sequentially from top to bottom.
2.  All function definitions (`reverse_string`, `word_count`, etc.) are processed and made available.
3.  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is entered because the script is being run as the main program.
4.  Inside this block:
    *   A string variable `text` is initialized to "Hello world".
    *   An integer variable `number` is initialized to 10.
    *   The `reverse_string`, `word_count`, `to_upper`, `is_even`, and `generate_numbers` functions are called with these variables or specified literals, and their results are printed to the console along with descriptive labels.
5.  The functions related to shopping cart calculations (`calculate_total_price`, `calculate_discounted_price`, `calculate_taxed_price`) are defined but not called within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, so their logic is not executed unless explicitly called elsewhere in the script or imported into another module.

## Dependencies
This file has no external dependencies. It uses only built-in Python types and functions.

## Important Notes
-   **Cart Item Structure**: The cart calculation functions (`calculate_total_price`, `calculate_discounted_price`, `calculate_taxed_price`) assume that `cart` is a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary contains at least `"price"` and `"quantity"` keys, both holding numeric values.
-   **Non-Positive Prices**: Items with a `price` less than or equal to `0` are explicitly excluded from the total calculation in the cart functions.
-   **Redundant Logic**: The core logic for calculating the sum of `(price * quantity)` is duplicated across `calculate_total_price`, `calculate_discounted_price`, and `calculate_taxed_price`. For larger systems, it might be beneficial to refactor this common calculation into a separate helper function to improve maintainability, though this is outside the scope of the current task.
-   **Type Handling**: The functions generally expect specific input types (e.g., `str` for string functions, `int` for `is_even`). Providing incorrect types might lead to runtime errors.

## Usage Example
```python
# Practical example of how to use this code

# Using string utilities
my_sentence = "Python is fun to learn!"
print(f"Original: '{my_sentence}'")
print(f"Reversed: '{reverse_string(my_sentence)}'")
print(f"Word Count: {word_count(my_sentence)}")
print(f"Uppercase: '{to_upper(my_sentence)}'")

print("-" * 20)

# Using number utilities
my_number = 25
print(f"Is {my_number} even? {is_even(my_number)}")
print(f"Numbers from 10 to 12: {generate_numbers(10, 12)}")

print("-" * 20)

# Using shopping cart utilities
shopping_cart = [
    {"item_name": "Laptop", "price": 1200.00, "quantity": 1},
    {"item_name": "Mouse", "price": 25.50, "quantity": 2},
    {"item_name": "Keyboard", "price": 75.00, "quantity": 1},
    {"item_name": "Gift Card", "price": -10.00, "quantity": 1} # Price <= 0 will be ignored
]

# Note: The 'item_name' key is ignored by the calculation functions.
# The functions only care about 'price' and 'quantity'.

print(f"Cart Total Price: ${calculate_total_price(shopping_cart):.2f}")
print(f"Cart Discounted Price (10% off): ${calculate_discounted_price(shopping_cart):.2f}")
print(f"Cart Taxed Price (18% tax): ${calculate_taxed_price(shopping_cart):.2f}")

```
