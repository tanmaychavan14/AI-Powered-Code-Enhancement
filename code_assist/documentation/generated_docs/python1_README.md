# python1.py - Documentation

## File Overview
This file defines a set of fundamental arithmetic operations. Its main responsibility is to provide basic mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a modular way. In a larger system, these functions could serve as a core utility for any component requiring simple numerical processing, or as foundational building blocks for a more complex calculator application.

## Key Components

### Functions

-   **`add(a, b)`**:
    -   **Purpose and functionality**: Performs addition of two numbers.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `a`: The first number.
        -   `b`: The second number.
    -   **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b`.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        result = add(7, 3)
        # result will be 10
        ```

-   **`subtract(a, b)`**:
    -   **Purpose and functionality**: Performs subtraction, taking `b` away from `a`.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `a`: The number from which to subtract.
        -   `b`: The number to subtract.
    -   **Returns**: The difference `a - b`.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        result = subtract(15, 8)
        # result will be 7
        ```

-   **`multiply(a, b)`**:
    -   **Purpose and functionality**: Performs multiplication of two numbers.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `a`: The first number.
        -   `b`: The second number.
    -   **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b`.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        result = multiply(4, 6)
        # result will be 24
        ```

-   **`divide(a, b)`**:
    -   **Purpose and functionality**: Divides the first number `a` by the second number `b`. Includes a check to prevent division by zero.
    -   **Parameters**:
        -   `a`: The dividend.
        -   `b`: The divisor.
    -   **Returns**:
        -   The quotient `a / b` if `b` is not zero.
        -   The string "Error: Cannot divide by zero!" if `b` is zero.
    -   **Usage Example**:
        ```python
        result1 = divide(20, 4)
        # result1 will be 5.0

        result2 = divide(10, 0)
        # result2 will be "Error: Cannot divide by zero!"
        ```

### Classes
This file does not contain any classes.

## Execution Flow
1.  The script defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, making them available for use.
2.  It then initializes two variables, `x` to `10` and `y` to `5`.
3.  It sequentially calls each of the defined arithmetic functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) using `x` and `y` as arguments.
4.  For each function call, the returned value is printed to the console, along with a descriptive label (e.g., "Addition:", "Subtraction:"). This demonstrates the immediate results of these operations.

## Dependencies
This file does not depend on any external libraries or modules. It uses only built-in Python features.

## Important Notes
-   The `divide` function specifically handles the edge case of division by zero by returning a descriptive error string. Developers consuming this function should be aware of this behavior and check the return value, especially for division operations, to differentiate between a numerical result and an error message.
-   These functions are designed for numerical inputs. Passing non-numeric types might lead to `TypeError` exceptions from the underlying Python operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

## Usage Example
```python
# Example usage:
x = 10
y = 5

print("Addition:", add(x, y))
print("Subtraction:", subtract(x, y))
print("Multiplication:", multiply(x, y))
print("Division:", divide(x, y))
```
